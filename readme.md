# Mutant Remix Build Files

This repository contains all of the files required to build a custom Mutant Remix package using Orxporter.

Mutant Remix is not affiliated with [Mutant Standard](https://mutant.tech/). This is a transformation of the original Mutant Standard emoji pack, created by nizune for [Revolt](https://revolt.chat/).

This repository has no warranty and has only been tested with Arch Linux. :)
